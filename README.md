2. **Room Availability**: Users can view available rooms based on their selected date range.
3. **Reservation Cancellation**: Users can cancel their reservations.
4. **Persistent Data**: Room and booking data is saved in CSV files (`rooms.csv` and `bookings.csv`).

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Make sure **Python 3.x** is installed.
3. Run the following command to start the program:
   ```bash
   python hotel_management.py
